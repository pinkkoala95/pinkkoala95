- 👋 Hi, I’m @pinkkoala95 aka Emma Keeley
- 👀 I’m interested in learning to code and in my spare time I play netball, spin, swim and walk my dog!
- 🌱 I’m currently learning the basics of HTML, CSS and Javascript on an Introduction to Web Development course with Code First Girls and will update my GitHub shortly with my projects! You can also take a look at my Code Pen account https://codepen.io/pinkkoala95
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any projects that would help me learn more about the fundamentals of coding
- 📫 You can contact me at emma.keeley@gmail.com
