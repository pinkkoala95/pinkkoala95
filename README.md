- 👋 Hi, I’m @pinkkoala95 aka Emma Keeley
- 👀 I’m interested in learning to code and in my spare time I play netball, spin, swim and walk my dog!
- 🌱 I’m currently on the CFG Fullstack Degree learning an incredible amount and I will update my GitHub shortly with my projects! 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any projects that would help me learn more about the fundamentals of coding
- 📫 You can contact me at emma.keeley@gmail.com
